**Concatenative site generation in Factor.**
"Warp" — Folding site data through the data stack. A generator where everything is a word.

== Who Is This For?
* **Stack-oriented developers** who value hyper-modular, concatenative logic.
* **Systems Architects** requiring high-level metaprogramming in a low-level footprint.
* **Minimalists** seeking a "code-as-data" approach to site synthesis.

== Why warp-ssg?
=== Word-Based Synthesis
In `warp-ssg`, site logic is decomposed into "words" pushed onto a data stack. This enables extreme reuse and testing of tiny functional units.

=== Homoiconic Templates
Code and data share the same representation in Factor. You can manipulate your site's generation logic *as data* during the build process for advanced self-modifying layouts.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Bootstrap Factor via asdf
just setup

# Build the site through the stack
just build
----

== Features
* **Stack-Oriented Metaprogramming** - High-level abstractions with zero overhead.
* **Podman-First** - Consistent builds across Linux, Minix, and PC.
* **Accessibility** - Native support for BSL, GSL, ASL, and Makaton.

== Requirements
* **Factor (latest stable)**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`warp-ssg` is the concatenative representative of the **poly-ssg** family.
